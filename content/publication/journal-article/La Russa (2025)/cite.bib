TI  - Potential Pathogenetic Role of the D313Y Mutation in the GLA Gene in Anderson 
      Fabry Disease: Two Case Reports.

LID - 4400
AB  - Anderson Fabry disease (AFD) is an X-linked hereditary lysosomal abnormality that 
      causes the accumulation of glycosphingolipids in body fluids and tissues, leading 
      to progressive organ damage and a shortened life span. More than 1000 mutations 
      in the GLA gene have been identified, promoting many different clinical pictures. 
      For this reason, diagnosing AFD can be difficult, especially because of the great 
      diversity of atypical clinical presentations that can simulate the disease. Some 
      of these variants of the GLA gene have been described as non-pathogenic. For 
      example, the D313Y variant is one of the most controversial, even if there are 
      several case reports of D313Y patients presenting with signs and symptoms 
      consistent with AFD without any other etiological explanation. This work aimed to 
      clarify whether the presence of the D313Y variant affects α-Gal A activity and 
      causes AFD symptoms and organ involvement in two patients from different 
      families. The presence of the D313Y variant resulted in clinical manifestations 
      of AFD in both patients and a decrease in alpha-galactosidase activity in the 
      male patient. Two patients (one female and one male) from two unrelated families 
      were examined. Sequencing of all seven GLA exons and the adjacent 5' and 3' 
      exon-intron boundaries identified the D313Y variant in exon 6, as well as the 
      genetic variation g.1170C>T in the flanking 5' UTR in patient 1 only. Our results 
      suggest that the D313Y variant is causative for the disease and that the clinical 
      phenotype can be enhanced by the presence of other variants modulating protein 
      expression.
