AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Anticholinergic medications are known to affect the 
      prognosis of older nursing home residents. Various anticholinergic scales were 
      developed to measure the cumulative anticholinergic burden; among them, the 
      CRIDECO Anticholinergic Load Scale (CALS) has recently emerged as a new tool to 
      identify patients with cognitive impairment due to anticholinergic burden. This 
      study aimed to externally validate the CALS and to evaluate the association of 
      CALS and the anticholinergic cognitive burden (ACB) scales with baseline 
      cognitive and functional impairment, as well as with 3-year mortality rates. 
      METHODS: A prospective cohort of 600 nursing home residents (mean age 80.4 ± 8.0 
      years; 69.8% women) underwent a comprehensive geriatric assessment. 
      Anticholinergic burden was assessed at baseline using both CALS and ACB scales. 
      Cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental State Examination < 24) and physical disability 
      (one or more impaired activities of daily living) were evaluated 
      cross-sectionally using a logistic regression model. Cox proportional hazards 
      models were used to estimate the association between anticholinergic burden and 
      3-year mortality, adjusting for age, sex, multimorbidity, nutritional status, and 
      cognitive and functional status. RESULTS: Among 600 nursing home residents 
      included in the study, 72.0% had cognitive impairment and 56.3% had at least one 
      activity of daily living limitation. The CALS and ACB scores were significantly 
      correlated ( ρ = 0.76), but CALS identified a higher number of residents with 
      moderate-to-high anticholinergic burden. Multivariate logistic regression showed 
      that CALS ≥ 2 was independently associated with cognitive impairment (odds ratio 
      1.84, 95% confidence interval 1.02-3.34), whereas ACB ≥ 2 was not. Both scales 
      were associated with activities of daily living disability, with a stronger 
      gradient and better goodness of fit for CALS than ACB. During the 3-year 
      follow-up, 25.3% of residents died. Cox regression analyses showed that residents 
      with CALS or ACB ≥ 2 had significantly lower survival over 3 years. In fully 
      adjusted Cox models, both CALS ≥ 2 (hazard ratio 1.93, 95% confidence interval 
      1.07-3.46) and ACB ≥ 2 (hazard ratio 1.69, 95% confidence interval 1.02-2.83) 
      remained associated with increased mortality. Prognostic performance was similar 
      (CALS C-index: 0.783; ACB: 0.781), but the model fit favored CALS. CONCLUSIONS: 
      In this cohort of nursing home residents, anticholinergic burden as measured by 
      both CALS and ACB was associated with baseline physical impairment and 3-year 
      mortality, but CALS showed a better goodness of fit. Between the two scales, CALS 
      only was independently associated with baseline cognitive impairment. These 
      findings support the clinical utility of CALS in assessing 
      anticholinergic-related risk among frail older adults in institutional settings.
