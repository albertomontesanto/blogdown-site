AB  - Nowadays, scientists are making efforts to elucidate the mechanisms involved in 
      the phenotypic changes underlying the aging process in order to develop favorable 
      therapeutical interventions. Epigenetic modifications, in particular DNA 
      methylation, play a crucial role in the aging process, and this parameter has 
      been used to set epigenetic clocks, algorithms that predict an individual's 
      biological age based on a defined set of CpGs. In this review, we focus on the 
      most recent literature to discuss the use of epigenetic clocks in the context of 
      cognitive decline and dysregulation of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related gene 
      expression. We have summarized all published scientific papers in which 
      epigenetic clocks have been applied to measure age acceleration in blood and 
      brain specimens from patients affected with AD. Progressive age acceleration, 
      consistent with a specific DNA methylation signature, was observed in patients 
      affected by AD, and it was correlated with the onset of complex diseases, 
      mitochondrial alterations, dementia and cognitive decline, even in the early 
      stages of these conditions. The use of epigenetic clocks might be a valuable 
      biomarker to enable an earlier identification of ideal measures to reverse 
      modifications caused by aging and to mitigate multiple aspects of disease/aging 
      mechanisms.
