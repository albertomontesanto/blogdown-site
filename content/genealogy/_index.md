## Our vision

Our team develops **genealogical portals**, **digital archives**, and **demographic reconstruction tools** for municipalities, cultural institutions, and scientific projects.  
We specialize in transforming historical documents into accessible online resources for citizens, researchers, and diasporic communities.

Building on the successful experience of the **Montegiordano Genealogy Portal**, many municipalities across Calabria have requested our consulting services to create their own genealogical platforms.

This project has inspired a broader initiative: several Calabrian municipalities have since asked for our **technical, archival, computational, and methodological support** to build their own genealogical portals.
